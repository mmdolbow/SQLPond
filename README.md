# SQLPond
For dipping your toes into the SQL Pond!

This repository is filled with examples of SQL code that can be used to build and explore data, focused on commonly used data in the State of Minnesota.

## SQL Fiddle
Want to test out this code? Try using one of the following:
1. http://sqlfiddle.com/ : If we can get this working, specific links to demonstrative fiddles are below. Tried  in several browsers on 2020.10.01, couldn't get it working.
2. https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_create_table : kind of tedious - inserts only one at a time - but works and has a quick Restore function
